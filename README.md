# Acids-SportTorrent-Renamer
Python script to rename SportTorrents files to TSDB naming convention to appease SportScanner Plex agent for proper metadata parsing


To request .csv data for your specific desired league, please visit "https://thesportsdb.com/" and find your League, and send me a Pull Request with the League ID associated with the League. _(i.e, https://thesportsdb.com/league/4380 - "4380" is the League ID for the NHL)_
I will refresh the Data folder every few days.
